# Romanian Tarok

## Preliminaries

**Players** 4, in variable partnership

**Cards** A 54-card tarot deck. The Fool is played as the highest
ranked trump card above the 21.

Card       | Points
---------- | ------
Trump 21   | 4
Pagat (1)  | 4
Fool       | 4
King       | 4
Queen      | 3
Cavalier   | 2
Jack       | 1
Others     | 0

**Objective** Take 36 or more card points to win the hand.

**Pool** At the beginning of the game, and every time the pool is
emptied, each player contributes one point to a pool. At the start of
every hand, the dealer contributes an additional point to the pool.

**Deal** Standard procedure, dealing out **12 cards** per player and **6
cards** to the talon.

## Bidding

Starting with **forehand** and continuing in turn order, each player
must bid or pass. Once a player passes they may not bid again. The
player with the highest bid becomes the **declarer**. If everyone
passes, the negative game **michi-michi** is played.

The available bids, in ascending order, are **Two**, **One**, and
**Solo**. The bid indicates the number of cards the bidder wishes to
exchange with the talon, 0 in the case of _Solo_.

In addition to bidding the number of cards they wish to exchange,
players may also announce which portion of the talon they will select.
For example, a bid of _Two_ may be outbid by a bid of _Second Two_,
which in turn may be outbid by _Third Two_. These bids increase the
level of the game. The basic _Two_ and _One_ bids have a game level
of 1. Bidding second, third, etc., increases the game level to 2, 3,
etc. respectively.

Players with higher preference may hold the bids of players with lower
preference.

| Contract | Value Won | Value Lost |
|:---------|:----------|:-----------|
| Two      | 2         | 2 * level  |
| One      | 3         | 3 * level  |
| Solo     | 8         | 8          |

## Calling a Partner

After the auction, the declarer calls for a partner by naming a king.
The player who holds the called king does not reveal themselves. Their
identity becomes known only by playing the called card. The declarer
may call a king that they hold, in which case they play alone against
the others, but doing so does not increase the value of the contract.

## Exchange

When the contract is _Two_ or _One_, the declarer exchanges cards with
the talon. The talon, still face down, is divided into 3 or 6 groups
of cards. The declarer, then picks up the group they said they would
take in the auction, for the basic _Two_ and _One_ bids this is the
first grouping, and privately examines it.

If they decide to keep the cards, they take them into their hand and
discard an equal number to their trick pile. If they don't want them,
they place them face up on the table, and then examine the next group.

This process repeats until either the declarer has exchanged cards or
all of the cards in the talon are face up on the table. In the later
case, the declarer may exchange with any group that they previously
examined but may only do so by moving through the groups sequentially,
increasing the game level again for each group they pass over.

Every time the declarer passes on a group of cards the level of the
game increases by 1. For example, if the contract is _Two_ and the
declarer selects the second group of cards after having examined the
entire talon, then the game level is 5, 1 plus a level for every group
that they passed over without selecting.

Cards worth 4 points may never be discarded. Trump may be discard when
there is no other choice, but they must be discard face up.

The unclaimed portion of the talon is set aside, and goes to the
defenders at the end of the hand.

### Called King in the Talon

If the called king is found in the talon, then the declarer must
either play alone or forfeit the game, paying the value of the game at
whatever level they are currently at.

If the declarer plays the game, but does not select the portion of the
talon that contains the called king after having examined it, then
they must pay each of the defenders 2 points.

In contracts other than _Solo_, if the called king is found in the
unexamined portion of the talon, then the king is returned to the
declarer in exchange for a low value card from their trick pile.

## Announcements

After the exchange, the declarer starts a round of announcements. 

| Bonus         | Silent | Announced | Player      | Description                                                                  |
|:--------------|:-------|:----------|:------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Trull         | 1      | 2         | Any         | All Trull in tricks                                                          |
| Four Kings    | 1      | 2         | Any         | All Kings in tricks                                                          |
| Mondfang      | 1      | 2         | Any         | Capture opponent's Trump 21                                                  |
| Valat         | 8 (32) | 16 (64)   | Any         | Win every trick                                                              |

**Solo** contracts typically **double** the value of silent and
announced bonuses. However, this is not true for declared trump, which
are always worth the same value, and _Pagat ultimo_ and _valat_. The
values of these bonuses are listed in parenthesis.

Declared trump only counts once per team for the higher number. It is
illegal to declare a smaller number of trump if you know your partner
has already declared a higher number.

If the declarer announces _Pagat ultimo_, then they must also declare
their trump holding if they hold more than 7 trump. Likewise, if
_Pagat ultimo_ is contra'd, then the contra-ing player must similarly
declarer their trump.

If a player announces _trull_ or _four kings_ and they are not on the
declarer's team, then they must also contra either the game or another
announcement that the declarer made to make it clear what team they
are on.

Announcements continue until three players pass in succession. After
the first round of announcements, players may only contra existing
announcements on subsequent rounds.

## Play

**Forehand** leads the first trick. Players must follow suit if able
and must trump otherwise. If they are unable to do either, then they
may play anything. Otherwise, standard trick-taking rules apply.

## Scoring

Each team counts their card points in **batches of three**, using the
standard method. Fractional values should be rounded to the nearest
integer. There are **70 card points** in total. The declarer needs at
least **36 card points** to win the hand.

The game and bonuses are evaluated independently. Each team member
must pay the value of a feat lost to the opposing team, who splits the
winnings equally.

- If a silent _Pagat ultimo_ or _king ultimo_ was attempted and
  failed, then the team attempting team must pay their opponents for
  the loss.
- If _valat_ is achieved, then there is no score for the basic game.
- If the game is contra'd, then the level multiplier applies to the
  value of the game won or lost, rather than only if it is lost.
- If multiple players on the same team made trump declarations, then
  only the highest valued declaration is paid.

### Announced Pagat Ultimo

When _Pagat ultimo_ is announced and achieved, then the declarer wins
the contents of the pool, which they split with their partner;
otherwise, they must double the contents of the pool.

If the announcement was contra'd, then the defenders must replenish
the pool to twice its current value if the ultimo succeeds. If it
fails, the defenders split the pool and the declarer's team must
replenish the pool to twice its value.

If the announcement is supra contra'd then the replenishment is four
times the value, etc.

## Michi-Michi

When the auction is passed out, _michi-michi_ is played. There are no
card points, and the goal is to avoid taking tricks. For each trick
taken, the player must pay one point to the pool.

The next four hands are played at double stakes, excluding payments to
the pool.

## Conventions

When the declarer's partner first leads to a trick, if they lead a
trump lower than 10 it indicates that they hold one of the top two
trump. If they lead a card 10 or above, it indicates that they **do
not** hold one of the top two trump and this is their highest trump.
