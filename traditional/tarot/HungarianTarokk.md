# Hungarian Tarokk

## Preliminaries

**Players** 4, in variable partnership

**Cards** A 42-card tarot deck. The Fool is played as the highest
ranked trump card above the 21.

| Card       | Points |
|:-----------|:-------|
| Trump 21   | 5      |
| Pagat (1)  | 5      |
| Fool       | 5      |
| King       | 5      |
| Queen      | 4      |
| Cavalier   | 3      |
| Jack       | 2      |
| Others     | 1      |

There are 94 card points in total.

The Pagat, the Fool, and Trump 21 are referred to as **honors**, and
the Fool and Trump 21 are **high honors**.

**Objective** Take 48 or more card points to win the hand.

**Deal** Standard procedure, dealing out **9 cards** per player and
**6 cards** to the talon.

## Bidding

The available bids, in ascending order, are **Three**, **Two**,
**One**, and **Solo**. The bid indicates the number of cards the
bidder wishes to exchange with the talon, 0 in the case of solo.
Additionally, the higher the bid, the more points the game is worth.

| Contract | Value |
|:---------|:------|
| Three    | 1     |
| Two      | 2     |
| One      | 3     |
| Solo     | 4     |

Starting with **forehand** and continuing in turn order, each player
must bid or pass. Once a player passes they may not bid again. A
player who has already bid, may hold the last bid, but a bid that has
already been held may not be held again. The player with the highest
bid becomes the **declarer**. If everyone passes, the hand is thrown
in and re-dealt.

If a player bids _Three_ and everyone else passes, then they may choose
to increase their bid.

In order to bid, players **must** hold at least one honor. If the
first three players pass, then the dealer may choose to bid even if
they do not hold an honor, hoping to find one in the talon. However,
if they bid without an honor and do not find one in the talon, then
they immediately lose the game.

### Invitations

The following bidding conventions, known as **invitations** must be
followed:

* Bidding one level higher than the next available bid promises that
  you hold **Trump 19**.
* Bidding two levels higher than the next available bid promises that
  you hold **Trump 18**.
* Passing after making an initial bid of _Three_ that was subsequently
  outbid by a bid of _Two_, promises that you hold **Trump 20** and at
  least one **high honor**.

If a player makes an invitation and different player wins the auction,
then the declarer is obligated to call the card promised in the
invitation.

If a player makes an invitation and does not hold a high honor, then
they must declarer _Pagat Ultimo_ during announcements.

Only one invitation may be made per auction, and any subsequent jump
bids are meaningless.

## Exchange

The declarer draws from the talon the number of cards that their bid
allows. These cards go directly into their hand and are not revealed.
The remaining cards in the talon are then distributed as equally as
possible between the other players, with the players closest to the
declarer's left receiving any extra cards.

Each player then discards back down to 9 cards. It is illegal to
discard any card that is worth 5 points or any card that was promised
in an invitation. The declarer's discards are kept separate and count
toward their score at the end of the hand. All other discarded cards
score for the defenders.

If anyone discards trump, they must announce how many trump they
discarded. Additionally, if the declarer discards trump, they must
show the trump they discarded.

## Calling a Partner

After the discard, the declarer calls for a partner by naming a trump
card. The holder of the called card is their partner, but they do not
reveal themselves.

If an invitation was made by a player other than the declarer, then
the declarer must call the promised card. Otherwise, they must call
for **Trump 20**. If they hold Trump 20, then they may choose to call
for the next highest trump below 20 that they do not hold.

## Announcements

Starting with the declarer, each player has a turn to make
announcements and/or contras. Announcements continue until three
players pass consecutively.

| Bonus        | Announced | Silent   | Description                  |
|:-------------|:----------|:---------|:-----------------------------|
| 8 Trump      | 1         | -        | Hold exactly 8 trump         |
| 9 Trump      | 2         | -        | Hold exactly 9 trump         |
| Trull        | 2         | 1        | All Trull in tricks          |
| Four Kings   | 2         | 1        | All Kings in tricks          |
| Pagat Ultimo | 10        | 5        | Win final trick with Trump 1 |
| Mondfang     | 42        | 21       | Capture opponent's Trump 21  |
| Double Game  | Game * 4  | Game * 2 | Win at least 71 points       |
| Volat        | Game * 6  | Game * 3 | Win every trick              |

If a player announced _Pagat Ultimo_, or contras another player's
ulti, then they are required to declare _8 Trump_ or _9 Trump_ if they
have them.

_Double Game_ and _Volat_ may not be announced during the same turn to
speak, and _Double Game_ may not be announced by a team that has
previously announced _Volat_.

Silent _Trull_ and _Four Kings_ are not paid in the case of a _Volat_.

When a player first makes an announcement, apart from declaring _8
Trump_ or _9 Trump_, it must be clear what team they are on. If it is
not clear, they are assumed to be on the same team as the person who
most recently made an announcement. If the player is not on this team,
they must contra the game or an announcement, making it clear which
team they are on, before making any new announcements.

_8 Trump_ and _9 Trump_ declarations are paid out immediately, with
all players paying the announcer regardless of the team they're on.

## Play

**Forehand** leads the first trick. Players must follow suit if able
and must trump otherwise. If they are unable to do either, then they
may play anything. Otherwise, standard trick-taking rules apply.

## Scoring

Each team counts their card points. There are **94 card points** in
total. The declarer needs at least **48 card points** to win the game.

If the game was not contra'd and neither _Double Game_ nor _Volat_
were announced, then the team that won scores for the highest level
that they achieved. That is to say, if the declarer bid _Two_ and took 75
points, then they'd score for a silent _Double Game_, `2 * 2 = 4`, but
would not get an additional 2 points for winning the game.

If the game was contra'd and/or _Double Game_ or _Volat_ were
announced, then the announced/contra'd feats will always be scored.
For instance, if the declarer bid _Two_, announced _Double Game_, and
made a silent _Volat_, then they'd score `(2 * 4) + (2 * 3) = 14`. On
the other hand, if they only managed to take 65 points, then the would
not score for the game and the defense would score `2 * 4 = 8`.

Similarly, if the declarer bid _Two_, the defenders contra'd the game,
and the defenders took 75 points, then the defense would score
`(2 * 2) + (2 * 2) = 8`. If they had not contra'd the game they would
have only scored for the silent _Double Game_, `2 * 2 = 4`.

All other bonuses are evaluated independent from who won the game.
Each team's cumulative winnings is summed, and each player on the
opposing team must pay one player this value.
