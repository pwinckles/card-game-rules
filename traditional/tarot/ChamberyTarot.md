# Chambéry Tarot

Chambéry Tarot is a basic tarot game that does not include any
bonuses, declarations, or announcements. It can be played with 3 to 5
players, and is an excellent intro tarot game.

## Preliminaries

**Players** 5, in variable partnership

**Cards** A 78-card tarot deck, using standard tarot values and
rankings. The Fool is played as the Excuse.

Card       | Points
---------- | ------
Trump 21   | 4
Pagat (1)  | 4
Fool       | 4
King       | 4
Queen      | 3
Cavalier   | 2
Jack       | 1
Others     | 0

**Objective** Capture at least **34 card points** to win the hand.

## Deal and Discard

Standard procedure, dealing out **15 cards** per player. The dealer
takes the remaining 3 cards into their hand and discards down to 15.
The discarded cards count for the **winner of the final trick**. The
following restrictions apply to the discard:

- Kings, the 21, and the Fool may never be discarded.
- Trump, other than the 21, may be discarded only if doing so leaves
  the player with no trump in hand.
- The player must announce when they discard the Pagat.

## Bidding

**Forehand** opens the bidding. Players who pass may not re-enter the
auction. The auction continues until there is only one player
remaining. The possible bids are as follows, in ascending order: **Two
Cards**, **One Card**, and **No Cards**. The player who wins the
auction is the declarer and plays alone against the other four.

The declarer has the privilege of asking for the number of cards
indicated in their winning bid (2, 1, or none) from the others. They
may ask for any card not in their hand apart from the Fool. The player
who holds the card must relinquish it, and the declarer chooses any
card in their own hand to give in return.

If everyone passes without bidding, the dealer must call for a king
not in their hand. The player who holds the called king immediately
identifies themselves, and the two play in partnership against the
other three. If the dealer holds all four kings, then they may call
for a queen.

## Play

**Forehand** leads the first trick. Players must follow suit if able
and must trump otherwise. If they are unable to do either, then they
may play anything. There is no requirement to head the trick.
Otherwise, standard trick-taking rules apply.

The team that wins the final trick receives the cards that the dealer
discarded at the beginning of the hand.

## Payments

Bid         | Multiplier
----------- | ----------
Called King | 1
Two Cards   | 1
One Card    | 2
No Cards    | 4

Each team counts their card points. Points are counted in **batches of
five**, using the standard method. The extra 3 cards are counted as 1
point so that there are no fractions. There are **68 card points** in
total.

Hard scoring is used, tracking each player's score individually on
paper or with chips. Teams must take more than **34 card points** to
win, and the amount they win is based on how many points they are over
or under 34.

If both teams make 34 points then there are no payments. Otherwise,
each player on the team that made fewer than 34 points loses the number
of points their team was off 34 times the multiplier of the winning
bid. This amount is doubled if the team took fewer than **17
card points**. The players on the winning team split the cumulative
points lost by the opposition equally between themselves.

If the payment cannot be divided equally between the players on the
winning team, then the losing team must increase their payment so that
each member on the winning team is able to be paid equally.

Examples:

1. Declarer and partner take 33 card points and owe 1 point each for a
   total payment of 2. This cannot be split between 3 players, so the
   declarer must pay an additional point.
2. Declarer and partner take 32 card points and owe 2 points each for
   a total payment of 4. This cannot be split between 3 players, so
   they each must pay an additional point.
3. Declarer and partner take 35 card points. Each defender owes 1
   point each for a total payment of 3. This cannot be split between 2
   players, so each defender must pay an additional point.

## Variations

### 4 Players

The rules are the same as the 5-player game with the following exceptions:

- **19 cards** are dealt to each player, and the dealer takes the remaining 2 cards.
- Cards are counted in **batches of four**, with the extra 2 cards
  counting as 1 point, so there are **72 card points** in total.
- More than **36 card points** are needed to win the hand.
- Payments are doubled when a team takes fewer than **18 card points**.

### 3 Players

**25 cards** are dealt to each player. The dealer takes the remaining
3 cards into their hand and discards following the usual rules. There
is no bidding. Each player plays for themselves. Cards are counted in
**batches of three**, making **78 card points** in total. Each player
who scores fewer than **26 card points** pays the amount they are
off 26. This amount is doubled if they took less than **13
card points**. If only one player takes more than 26 points, then they
receive all of the paid points. Otherwise, if two players are over 26,
each player gains the number of points they were over 26, doubled if
the losing player had fewer than 13 points.
