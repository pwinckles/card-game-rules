# Call-Ace Whist

## Preliminaries

**Players** 4, playing individually

**Cards** A standard 52-card deck, plus 3 jokers. Aces are high.

**Objective** Take at least as many tricks as bid with or without a partner

**Deal** Standard procedure, dealing hands of **13** and a kitty of **3**

## Bidding

**Forehand** opens the auction. A bid is the minimum number of tricks
that you think you can win, **minimum 7**. Players must either outbid
by bidding a higher contract or pass, removing them from the remainder
of the auction.

In addition to the target number of tricks, a bid may also have a
modifier. The modifiers are as follows:

- **Good**: Called partner; clubs trump
- **Sense**: Called partner; no trump
- **Turn**: Called partner; _must_ exchange with kitty. Flip top
  card of kitty. Either accept suit as trump or flip the next card.
  Must accept the suit of the final card.
- **Half**: Called partner. _Partner_ picks trump and may exchange
  with the kitty
- **Quarter**: Play alone; pick trump

The following negative games may also be bid, they are all played
alone with no trump:

- **Sun**: Win exactly one trick
- **Clean sun**: Win no tricks
- **Table**: Win exactly one trick; expose hand after first trick
- **Clean table**: Win no tricks; expose hand after first trick
- **Double table**: Win no tricks; everyone exposes their hand after
  first trick
  
The bids are ranked as follows:

| Contract     | Points |
|--------------|--------|
| 7            | 1      |
| 7+           | 2      |
| 8            | 2      |
| Sun          | 5      |
| 8+           | 4      |
| 9            | 4      |
| 7 Quarter    | 2      |
| Clean sun    | 10     |
| 9+           | 8      |
| 10           | 8      |
| Table        | 20     |
| 8 Quarter    | 4      |
| 10+          | 16     |
| 11           | 16     |
| 9 Quarter    | 8      |
| 11+          | 32     |
| 12           | 32     |
| Clean table  | 20     |
| 10 Quarter   | 16     |
| 12+          | 64     |
| 13           | 64     |
| Double table | 40     |
| 11 Quarter   | 32     |
| 13+          | 128    |
| 12 Quarter   | 64     |
| 13 Quarter   | 128    |

The **+** contracts are contracts with a modifier, except for Quarter.
At the same level, modifiers rank in ascending order: Turn, Good,
Sense, Half.

## Post-auction

If the declarer's contract allows them choose trump, they announce
the suit immediately after the auction.

If the contract has a called partner, they next call for a non-trump
ace. The holder of this card is their partner, and they do not reveal
themselves until the card is played. If the declarer holds all four
aces, they may call for a king instead. If the called card is in the
declarer's hand or in the kitty, then they play alone.

Finally, the declarer may choose to discard three cards and pickup the
kitty.

In the case of a Half contract, then it is the declarer's partner who
picks trump and may exchange.

## Play

**Forehand** leads the first trick. A joker may not be led to the
first trick. Standard trick-taking rules apply,
with the exception of the jokers.

When led to a trick, a joker will always win, even if trumped. When
following to a trick, a joker will always lose.

## Scoring

The value of the game is the value of the contract multiplied by one
plus the number of over/under tricks. For example, if the contract is
8 Turn and the declarer makes 10 tricks, then the value of the game is
`4 * 3 = 12`.

If the declarer's team took at least as many tricks as they
contracted, then each member of the losing team pays the value of the
game. Otherwise, each member of the winning team is paid the value of
the game.
