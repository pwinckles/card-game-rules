## Preliminaries ##

**Players** 4, in variable partnership

**Cards** 5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A in four suits plus two identical
jokers, 42 cards. The cards use standard European point-trick rankings
and values. There are 120 card-points in total.

| Card  | Points |
|-------|--------|
| Jack  | 2      |
| Queen | 3      |
| King  | 4      |
| 10    | 10     |
| Ace   | 11     |

All other cards are worth 0 points.

The trump suit is headed by the jokers followed by all of the jacks
followed by all of the cards in a variable suit, for a total of 15
cards. For example, if diamonds is trump, the trump suit would be
the following in ascending order:
♦5-♦6-♦7-♦8-♦9-♦Q-♦K-♦10-♦A-♦J-♥J-♠J-♣J-Jo-Jo. The jacks are always
ranked in the same ascending order,♦-♥-♠-♣.

The plain suits contain 9 cards each, and rank in the following
ascending order: 5-6-7-8-9-Q-K-10-A.

**Objective** Take at least 61 card-points.

**Deal** Standard procedure, dealing out all of the cards and 2 cards
to the kitty.

## Bidding ##

| Game       | Value | Description                                                       |
|------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Partner    | 1     | Play with a partner and a trump suit, with/without an exchange    |
| Solo       | 2     | Play alone with a trump suit, with/without an exchange            |
| Baby Grand | 3     | Play alone with an exchange and only jokers and jacks as trump    |
| Grand Hand | 4     | Play alone without an exchange and only jokers and jacks as trump |

Starting with **forehand**, each player may either pass or bid by
saying "I'll play." If a player wants to bid after another player has
opened, then they must indicate the game they want to play. Then, the
first player must respond by either accepting the bid or passing. If
the first player accepts the bid, then the second player must decide
if they want to raise their bid or pass. This back and forth continues
until one of the players has passed.

Bids are raised by either bidding a more valuable game, or by doubling
the value of the current game. A game may be doubled any number of
times.

The player who takes the bid is the **declarer**. The declarer may
change their bid to a higher value game after the auction is over, but
before moving on to the next step.

If everyone passes, then forehand _must_ play a game. However, if they
play a Partner game, then they may take the entire kitty into their
hand prior to naming trump and calling a partner, in exception to the
normal rules.

## Making Trump ##

If the game is Partner or Solo, then the declarer must now decide how
they're going to make trump. They may either play hand and name their
suit, or exchange with the kitty but accept one of the suits in the
kitty as trump, tournee.

If they play hand, the kitty goes into the declarer's trick pile,
without being examined, and they name any suit as trump.

If they play tournee, they flip over the first card of the kitty, and
decide if they accept the turned suit as trump. If a joker is turned,
any suit may be named. If they do not want it, they may flip the
second card, thereby making the suit of the second card trump.
Additionally, flipping the second card doubles the value of the game
**if lost**. Then, they take both cards into their hand, and discard
any two cards facedown to their trick pile.

## Calling a Partner ##

If the game is Partner, then the declarer must call a partner by
naming a plain suit ace that is not in their hand. Additionally, they
must hold at least one card in the ace's suit. If they cannot meet
these conditions, then they must call the lowest card in a plain suit
that they hold an ace in.

The player who holds the called card is the declarer's partner. They
do not reveal themselves until the called card is played.

The declarer may not intentionally call a card in their hand. If they
are playing hand, and the called card is in the kitty, then they play
alone.

## Grand ##

In Grand games, a plain suit is not elevated to trump. Only the jokers
and jacks are trump. In Baby Grand, the declarer is allowed to pickup
the kitty and make an exchange. In Grand Hand, there is no exchange.

## Play ##

The **forehand** leads the first trick. Standard trick-taking rules
apply.

If two jokers are played to the same trick, then the **second** joker
wins.

The called card must be played to the first trick in the card's suit.
It may not be smeared.

## Scoring ##

When the hand is over, the declaring team counts how many card-points
they took to determine which team won the hand. The declarer needs 61
or more points to win. If they took 91 or more points, they score an
additional point for schneider, and if they took all of the tricks,
they score another point for schwarz. Schneider and schwarz are
additive. Similarly, if they failed to take at least 31 points, then
they'd lose an additional point for being schneidered.

The total value of the hand is the game's base value plus a point if a
team was schneidered plus a point if a team was schwarzed. If the game
was doubled during the auction, the doubling applies to the total
value; not just the base value. Finally, if the declarer made trump on
the second flip of a tournee and lost, then the total value is also
doubled.

Each member of the losing team pays the total value to the opposing
team, who shares the winnings equally.

Some examples:

- A Partner game is won with 65 points. Each player on the losing team
  loses 1 point and each member of the winning team gains 1 point.
- A Partner game is lost with 30 points after making trump on the
  second flip. Each member of the declaring team loses 4 points and
  each member of the other team gains 4 points.
- A Solo game is won with 91 points. The declarer gains 9 points, and
  the other three players each lose 3 points.

## Variations ##

- When two jokers are played to the same trick, the first joker played
  wins. This makes it easier for the declarer.
- There are no restrictions on how the called card is played. This
  makes it easier for the declarer.
- Doubling only applies to the base game value and not the total value
  of the hand.
- Losing after flipping two cards in a tournee does not double the
  value of the game.
