# Solo Whist 2

## Preliminaries

**Players** 4, playing individually

**Cards** A standard 52-card deck. Aces are high.

**Objective** Take at least as many tricks as bid with or without a partner

**Deal** Standard procedure, dealing out hands of **13** cards

## Bidding

**Forehand** opens the auction. A bid is the number of tricks that you
think you can win, **minimum 8**, with or without a partner. Players
must either outbid by bidding a higher contract or pass, removing them
from the remainder of the auction.

| Contract  | Description                    | Value               |
|-----------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| 8-13      | Take `N` tricks with a partner | 10/trick bid over 7 |
| Misère    | Take 0 tricks with no trump    | 30                  |
| Solo 8-13 | Take `N` tricks alone          | 20/trick bid over 7 |

Within the same contract level, bids of a higher number of tricks
outrank bids of smaller numbers.

After winning the auction, the declarer names the trump suit or no
trump, and calls for an ace the holder of which is their partner.
Their partner is not revealed until they play the called card.

If everyone passes the cards are shuffled and redealt.

## Play

**Forehand** leads the first trick. Standard trick-taking rules apply.

## Scoring

The value of the hand is the number of tricks bid over seven times 10,
for a partnership game, or 20 for solo plus 5 points per over/under
trick.

If the declarer's team made at least as many tricks as they bid, then
each opponent pays the value of the hand. Otherwise, they are each
paid the value of the hand.

For example, if the bid was Solo 9 and 10 tricks were made, then the
value of the hand is `(9 - 7) * 20 + 5 = 45`. Each opponent loses 45
points and the declarer gains a total of 135.

In the case of Misère, the value of the hand is a flat 30.
